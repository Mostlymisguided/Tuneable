        <h1>🎶 About Tuneable</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Tuneable</strong> is a social music app that puts the power of the playlist in your hands — and your friends’. Whether you're at a house party, a café, or a boat in the middle of nowhere, Tuneable lets everyone join the music conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          No more fighting over the aux cable or suffering through someone else’s taste. With Tuneable, you can <strong>bid on songs</strong>, <strong>vote tracks to the top</strong>, and <strong>create shared queues in real time</strong> — democratically, dynamically, and with a little skin in the game.

        <h2>✨ How it Works</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Create or join a party</li>
          <li>Request songs from across major platforms</li>
          <li>Bid to boost your favourites</li>
          <li>Watch the queue evolve live</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The highest bid plays next — simple as that. It’s group listening, gamified.</p>

        <h2>🎯 Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Tuneable is a registered Community Interest Company (CIC)</strong>, built to benefit the wider community rather than private shareholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our aims include:
        </p>
         <ul>
    <li>Promote healing and communication through music;</li>
    <li>Democratically and transparently chart the global music catalogue;</li>
    <li>Empower artists by encouraging users to pay a fair price for music;</li>
    <li>Promote the adoption of more resonant musical tuning standards such as A4 = 432hz;</li>
    <li>Provide participatory musical experiences in public and private spaces;</li>
    <li>Support wellness initiatives such as sound therapy and mobile or floating healing venues.</li>
  </ul>
        <p>
          We believe music should bring people together — not just through algorithms, but through <em>intention</em> and <em>interaction</em>.

        <h2>🌍 Why Now?</h2>
        <p>
          There are over <strong>600 million music streaming subscribers</strong> globally. But most group settings still rely on whoever’s got the phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tuneable changes that. It's a live, local, collective jukebox — powered by community and backed by micropayments.

        <h2>👥 Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          A small crew of music-obsessed builders, designers, and dreamers — including musicians, developers, DJs, and a sprinkle of weirdos. Tuneable is independently built, community-driven, and open to collaboration.
        </p>
