Dear YouTube Partnerships Team,

I am writing to you as the founder of **Tuneable CIC**, a UK Community Interest Company (Company Number: [CIC Number]), to request formal partnership discussions and commercial alignment regarding our use of the YouTube Data API.

## About Tuneable

Tuneable is a community-funded artist support platform that allows fans to tip artists and influence the social ranking of songs at events and online parties. Our platform facilitates fan tipping, social queueing, and artist support—we are **not a music streaming service**.

### Our Mission

As a Community Interest Company, Tuneable exists to increase income for musicians and rights-holders by turning passive listening into active community support. Our CIC status demonstrates that Tuneable is not exploiting third-party content commercially, but rather redistributing fan support to artists.

## Current YouTube Data API Usage

Tuneable currently uses the YouTube Data API in compliance with YouTube's Terms of Service and API Services Terms. Our usage is limited to:

- **Accessing publicly available video metadata** (title, artist, duration, thumbnails) for display and search purposes
- **Linking users to YouTube creators and content** to support artists financially
- **Using the official YouTube embedded player** for user-initiated playback only

### Compliance with YouTube API Requirements

Tuneable fully complies with all YouTube API requirements:

✅ **We do not charge users for access to YouTube content**  
✅ **We do not circumvent YouTube advertisements**  
✅ **We use only the official YouTube embed player**  
✅ **We follow YouTube branding guidelines**  
✅ **We do not download, store, or rehost any YouTube content**  
✅ **We respect YouTube API quota limits and usage policies**

### Revenue Model

Money exchanged on Tuneable is for **social influence, ranking, tipping artists, and party participation**—not for streaming or content access. This model is similar to:

- Twitch Bits (viewers pay to influence stream events)
- TikTok Gifts (users pay to support creators)
- Patreon support (fans pay to support artists)
- Reddit coins (users pay for community features)

**We do not monetize YouTube playback itself.** Playback is incidental, user-initiated, and uses the official YouTube player only.

## What We're Requesting

We would like to discuss:

1. **API Compliance & Best Practices**
   - Confirmation that our current usage is compliant
   - Guidance on best practices for commercial API usage
   - Any recommended improvements to our implementation

2. **Optional Commercial Licensing for Scale**
   - If available, commercial licensing options for expanded API usage
   - Quota management and scaling considerations
   - Partnership benefits for supporting artists

3. **How Tuneable Can Drive Traffic and Revenue Back to YouTube**
   - Our platform drives users to YouTube creators and content
   - We facilitate financial support for artists (which benefits YouTube creators)
   - We can provide analytics on traffic and engagement we drive to YouTube

4. **Artist Verification Flows**
   - Potential integration with YouTube's creator verification systems
   - Streamlined processes for artists to claim revenue from Tuneable
   - Collaboration on artist support initiatives

## Our Commitment

**If YouTube prefers we disable certain features or modify our usage, we will comply immediately.** Tuneable can continue operating using alternative metadata sources (MusicBrainz, Discogs, Spotify API, Apple Music API, SoundCloud, ISRC databases, user-submitted metadata, or artist uploads) while maintaining all core functionality as a queueing engine, bidding system, and social jukebox platform.

However, we believe that a formal partnership would be mutually beneficial:

- **For YouTube:** Increased traffic, engagement, and financial support for YouTube creators
- **For Artists:** Additional revenue streams and community support
- **For Tuneable:** Clear compliance path and potential for growth

## Legal Framework

We have comprehensive Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that clearly outline:

- Our platform nature (tipping/social platform, not streaming service)
- YouTube API usage and compliance
- Artist revenue escrow system (3-year escrow for unclaimed funds)
- Opt-out and takedown procedures
- User responsibilities and limitations of liability

All legal documents are publicly available at:
- Terms of Service: https://tuneable.stream/terms-of-service
- Privacy Policy: https://tuneable.stream/privacy-policy

## Next Steps

We would be grateful for the opportunity to:

1. Schedule a call or meeting to discuss partnership opportunities
2. Receive feedback on our current API usage and compliance
3. Understand any requirements or recommendations for commercial API usage
4. Explore how Tuneable can best support YouTube creators and drive value back to YouTube
