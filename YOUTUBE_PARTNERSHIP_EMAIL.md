Hello YouTube Partnerships Team,

I am the founder of **Tuneable CIC**, a UK Community Interest Company that facilitates fan tipping and artist support through social music queueing and ranking systems.

## About Tuneable

Tuneable allows fans to tip artists and influence the social ranking of songs at events and online parties. Our platform uses the official YouTube embedded player for user-initiated playback and accesses video metadata through the YouTube Data API.

**Key Points:**
- **Tuneable is not a streaming service** – we facilitate fan tipping, social queueing, and artist support
- **Playback is incidental and user-initiated** – we use only the official YouTube embedded player
- **We do not charge users for access to YouTube content** – revenue relates solely to tips and fan interactions, not streaming or content access
- **We do not download, store, or rehost any YouTube content** – we only access publicly available metadata through the YouTube Data API

## Our Use of YouTube Data API

Tuneable uses the YouTube Data API for:
- Accessing video metadata (title, artist, duration, thumbnails) for display and search purposes
- Linking fans to YouTube creators and content
- Supporting artists financially through our escrow and revenue sharing system
- Embedding the official YouTube player for user-initiated playback (per YouTube Terms of Service)

We comply with all YouTube API requirements:
- ✅ We do not charge users for access to YouTube content
- ✅ We do not circumvent YouTube advertisements
- ✅ We use only the official YouTube embed player
- ✅ We follow YouTube branding guidelines
- ✅ We do not download, store, or rehost any YouTube content
- ✅ We respect YouTube API quota limits and usage policies

## Our Revenue Model

Money exchanged on Tuneable is for:
- **Social influence and ranking** – users tip to influence party queues
- **Artist support** – tips are distributed to artists through our escrow system
- **Party participation** – community features and social interactions

This model is similar to Twitch Bits, TikTok Gifts, or Patreon support, where users pay to support creators and influence community features, not to access content.

## Community Interest Company Status

As a UK Community Interest Company (CIC), Tuneable exists to:
- **Increase income for musicians and rights-holders** by turning passive listening into active community support
- **Redistribute fan support to artists** through our escrow and revenue sharing system
- **Support the music community** through transparent, artist-friendly practices

Our CIC status demonstrates that Tuneable is not exploiting YouTube content commercially, but rather redistributing fan support to artists and creators.

## What We're Requesting

We would like to formalize our use of the YouTube Data API and discuss:

1. **API Compliance & Best Practices**
   - Confirm our current usage is compliant
   - Understand any additional requirements for commercial use
   - Discuss best practices for API usage at scale

2. **Optional Commercial Licensing**
   - Explore commercial licensing options if available
   - Understand requirements for scaling our platform
   - Discuss partnership opportunities

3. **How Tuneable Can Drive Traffic and Revenue Back to YouTube**
   - Our platform drives users to YouTube for playback
   - We link directly to YouTube creators and channels
   - We support artists who create content on YouTube
   - We can provide analytics on traffic driven to YouTube

4. **Artist Verification Flows**
   - Discuss how we can verify artists and rights-holders
   - Explore integration opportunities for artist verification
   - Understand how to best support YouTube creators

## Our Commitment to Compliance

**If YouTube prefers we disable certain features or modify our usage, we will comply immediately.** We are committed to:
- Full transparency in our API usage
- Immediate compliance with any YouTube requests
- Maintaining a positive relationship with YouTube and Google
- Supporting YouTube creators and driving traffic to the platform

## Alternative Data Sources

We understand that API access may be subject to change. Tuneable is designed to be resilient and can continue operating using alternative metadata sources (MusicBrainz, Discogs, Spotify API, Apple Music API, SoundCloud, ISRC databases, user-submitted metadata, or artist uploads) while maintaining all core functionality as a queueing engine, bidding system, and social jukebox platform.

However, we believe that a formal partnership with YouTube would be mutually beneficial and would allow us to better support YouTube creators and drive traffic to the platform.

## Next Steps

I would be happy to:
- Schedule a call to discuss our platform and API usage in detail
- Provide a demo of Tuneable and how we use the YouTube Data API
- Share our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy for review
- Answer any questions about our platform, business model, or CIC structure
- Work with your team to ensure full compliance and best practices

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
